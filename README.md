# Tisane API plug-in for Coral Project Talk
Seamless integration between Tisane API and Coral Project Talk

Tisane API is used as a moderation aid, similar to Perspective API, but with support of 27 languages and more transparency. Tisane allows pinpointing the offending snippet and a type of offense instead of producing a scalar determining "toxicity". Tisane is also much less susceptible to false positives. 

Types of abuse detected:

* personal attacks (profane or non-profane)
* hate speech
* sexual advances
* criminal activity
* attempts to establish external contact or arrange payment
